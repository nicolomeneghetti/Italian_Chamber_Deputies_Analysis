This repository contains the codes for running classification and prediction of party switching in the Italian Chamber of Deputies. 
A thorough description of the results and the codes here used can be found in the paper published on iScience (which is open access): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.107098

!! IMPORTANT !!
Please note that this repository does not contain the data for running the machine learning (namley, random forest classifiers) algorithms. Specifically, the repository does not contain the voting records of the voting sessions of the last two legislatures of the Italian Chamber of Deputies as we do not own them. The data are however freely available and can be downloaded from https://dati.camera.it/it/. 
The data structure for running the code is thoroughly described in the codes and is also reported here: 



The main codes are the following two:
